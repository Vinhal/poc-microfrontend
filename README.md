# POC Microfrontend with Shared Context

This example demos a host application wrapped in a ContextProvider and exports this context and a
custom hook to be used by other applications.

- `host` is the host application 
- `app1` is the host application 

# Running Demo

Run `yarn start`. This will build and serve both `host` and `app1` on ports 3000 and 3001 respectively.

- [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/)
- [localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001/)
